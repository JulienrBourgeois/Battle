# Battle

This was my third ever project after UNO and Connect Four. I did this in the app lab on code.org during about a five day span and submitted it for the 2021 Congressional App Challenge. Although I placed 2nd in the contest, I am very happy that I made this app as it is a tribute to my Paw Paw. We used to play Battle all the time when I was a little kid and to be able to digitize the game really hit a soft spot of mine.

This app consists of a user vs computer, similar to my UNO and Connect Four games. However, there is so much more complications that have to go into this game to make it function properly. I was also able to take some of my past mistakes in UNO and Connect Four and fix them with this app! For example, I separated alot of my code with comments, named my variables accordingly and even made optimal methods for certain program executions!

To start the game, the user enters their name and hits begin. We also have options for the user to turn off the audio and view the rules. I also made several cool designs and color schemes within this app that I liked a lot! After the user hits play, they are presented with a top down view of the game. On the top of the screen is the computer's card and card count. At the bottom of the screen, is the player's card and card count. On the left, their is a button to play a single turn. On the right, their is a one time button to shuffle the cards if the user is struggling. 

When the play turn button is clicked, the results are shown and the screen returns. Once the player or computer runs out of all their cards, the game is over. If the player wins, they have the option to add their score to a leaderbooard. This was a major turning point in my high school programming career as I had finally figured out how to save data in the app lab. I was able to save player ID's and their time to completion as well as amount of turns.

That's the basic rundown of Battle. Now, let's get down to the code!
